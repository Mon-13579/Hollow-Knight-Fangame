            Items are seperated into 3 diferent types, <span class="redtext" >Offensive (red)</span>, <span class="silvertext" >Defensive (Silver)</span>, <br> 
            and <span class="yellowtext" >Utility (Yellow)</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            Each type has a diferent function, <span class="redtext" >Offensive (red)</span> items are used offensively, being items like the <span class="redtext">Fragile Mask</span>, which boosts damage a <br>
            bit upon being broken. <br>
            <span class="silvertext">Defensive (Silver)</span> tools are, as the name suggests, Defensive, being ones like the <span class="silvertext" >Thickened Mask</span>, which gives one temporary mask. <br>
            <span class="yellowtext">Utility (Yellow)</span> tools are passive effects that don't have much baring on combat, such as the <span class="yellowtext">Compass</span>.
