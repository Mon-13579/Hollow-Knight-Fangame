            Higher Beings are the gods of the Hollow Knight world. <br>
            <span class="greentext" >They can create whole biomes with a mere dream</span>, <br>
            <span class="orangetext" >They can plague the dreams of every bug in a kingdom</span>, <br>
            <span class="darkbluetext">They can be the cause of a potentially live saving substance.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            And the most elite among them <br>
            <span class="paletext">Pale Beings</span> <br>
            Can give sentience to lesser bugs akin to beasts.

            One of our Higher Beings is Kepril, the Higher Being of Rebirth. <br>
            This Higher Being is worshipped for being unkillable, and it is believed <br>
            that through worship of Kepril, one can achieve immortality, or something similar
