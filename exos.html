    <h2>
        Exoskeletons are the equivilant of Crests in Crysalost
    </h2>
    <p>
        There are going to be around 5 ExoSkeletons in the full game. <br>
        1. <a href="exos_Steel-Shell.html" class="silvertext" >Steel Shell.</a> <br>
        Steel Shell is a very tanky crest, it lowers your movement speed a bit, and increases damage slightly, <br>
        but it also lets you press the [Special] button to hide in your shell for ~3 seconds where you can move <br>
        at half speed, it primarily has <span class="silvertext" >Defensive</span> item slots, with two <span class="yellowtext">Utilities</span>, 1 <span class="redtext" >Offensive</span>, and 3 <span class="silvertext" >defensive</span>. <br>
        It also removes ALL double damage.
