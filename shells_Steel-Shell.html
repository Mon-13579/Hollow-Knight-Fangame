            Steel Shell is an Shell that is very <span class="silvertext" >Defence</span> focused.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is a slightly slower shell than the default, dealing slightly more damage in return.
        </p>
        <p>
            This Shell's special ability is hiding in your shell for around 3 seconds, during which time, <br>
            you are immune to all damage, but move at half speed.
