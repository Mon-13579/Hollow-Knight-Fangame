        There are going to be around 5 Shells in the full game. <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        1. <a href="shells_Steel-Shell.html" class="silvertext" >Steel Shell.</a> <br>
        Steel Shell is a very tanky Shell, it lowers your movement speed a bit, and increases damage slightly, <br>
        but it also lets you press the [Special] button to hide in your shell for ~3 seconds where you can move <br>
        at half speed, it primarily has <span class="silvertext" >Defensive</span> item slots, with two <span class="yellowtext">Utilities</span>, 1 <span class="redtext" >Offensive</span>, and 3 <span class="silvertext" >Defensive</span>. <br>
        It also removes ALL double damage.
    </p>
    <p>
        2. <a href="shells_Voided-Shell.html" class="voidtext" >Voided Shell.</a> <br>
        The Voided Shell is a very volitile Shell. Bathed in Void from the deep Abyss, this Shell is a gift <br>
        from ShadeCarer Pawe upon finishing their final quest. This Shell makes you immune to all <br>
        <span class="voidtext">Void Damage</span>, but removes one of your masks while you have it equiped.
    </p>
    <p>
        3. <a href="shells_Duelist-Shell.html" class="redtext" >Duelist Shell</a> <br>
        The Duelist Shell is a dificult shell to master, with its low attack speed but high damage per hit,<br>
        you need to time hits well, or you'll get punished. <br>
        This Shell's gimick is Parrys, while you can Parry with any Shell, parrying with the Duelist Shell will<br>
        A) increase damage by x0.5 on your next hit, and <br>
        B) deal x0.5 of your damage to the thing you parried (when it would normally cancel out the damage on <br>
        both sides)
